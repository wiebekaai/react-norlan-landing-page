# üßê Takeaways

- Small, looping videos add a nice dynamic touch to the design!
- You can show off on the desktop version while keeping the mobile version usable. An animation based on scroll for the [crossfade features section](/components/sections/crossfade-features.jsx) translates to a simple carousel on mobile.
- You can stagger CSS transitions using delays, see [header](/components/sections/hero-header.jsx).
- [react-scroll-parallax](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/intro) makes implementing parallaxes a breeze. I do recommend reading about the parallax effect and plain javascript implementations to get a good understanding.
- `react-scroll-parallax` works fine on the [crossfade features section](/components/sections/crossfade-features.jsx). However, it does not play perfectly on larger screens. Here are some resources that could help when implementing a more stable solution:
